### Runner
This folder contains all the benchmarks used in the thesis. The synthetic benchmarks will generate the graph when it could not be found in ./workload/generated/.
For real datasets, the graph.nt file must be present in the ./workload/ folder. See [graphProcessing](https://github.com/lucdon/LCRIndexing/graphProcessing/README.md) for downloading and processing real datasets.
Each individual file must be run from the project root.
